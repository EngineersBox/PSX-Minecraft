/**
 * @file spi.h
 * @brief Asynchronous SPI controller driver
 *
 * @details This is a fairly complete timer driven, asynchronous high-speed SPI
 * driver, with support for sending custom commands (including memory card
 * access), in about 200 lines of code. Feel free to copy and adapt it.
 *
 * The way this works is by maintaining a queue of requests to send, each with
 * its own payload and callback. Timer 2 is configured to trigger an IRQ at
 * regular intervals. On each tick, the next request in the queue (or a poll
 * command if no request is pending) is prepared and the first byte is
 * sent; if the controller asks for more data by pulling /ACK low, the next
 * byte is sent and the received byte is placed into a buffer. This goes on
 * until the last byte is exchanged and the controller stops asserting /ACK.
 *
 * On the next tick, the response buffer is passed to the request's callback
 * and reset, and the next request in the queue is sent. This blindly assumes
 * it only takes one tick for a request/response to be sent, which is the case
 * for controllers' very small packets but not for memory cards. It is
 * advisable to call spi_set_poll_rate() to temporarily reduce poll rate while
 * accessing memory cards.
 *
 * Note that this driver completely takes over the SPI bus, so you won't be
 * able to use any BIOS functions that rely on SPI access (i.e. pad and memory
 * card APIs) alongside it.
