# PSX-Minecraft

Remake of Minecraft for PS1 with PSn00bSDK

## Dependencies

* Emulator: [PCSX Redux](https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux)
* PS1 Library: [PSn00bSDK](https://github.com/Lameguy64/PSn00bSDK)

## Building

Configuring the project can be done with

```shell
cmake --preset default .
```

Then the CD image can be built with

```shell
cmake --build ./build
```

This will create several files in the `build` directory. Using the
PCSX Redux emulator, you can load the `build/PSXMC.bin` CD image
and run it.
